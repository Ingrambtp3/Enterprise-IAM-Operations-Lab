# Phase 3 — Identity Governance

## Objective
Define how access is governed, reviewed, and corrected over time to prevent access creep,
stale privileges, and unmanaged risk.

## Core Governance Questions
- How does access change when identities change?
- Who is responsible for reviewing access?
- How often is access reviewed?
- What happens when access is no longer appropriate?

## Governance Principles
- Access ownership is explicit
- Reviews are periodic and enforced
- Privileged access is time-bound and monitored
- Exceptions are documented and expire

## Scope
- Identity lifecycle (Joiner / Mover / Leaver)
- Access reviews
- Privileged access governance
- Guest and external identity governance

## Relationship to Other Phases
- Builds on Phase 1 (rules and boundaries)
- Governs Phase 2 (access control decisions)
- Relies on Phase 4 (logging) for visibility

## Status
In Progress
