# Enterprise-IAM-Operations-Lab
An enterprise-style Identity &amp; Access Management (IAM) operations lab simulating real-world governance, access control, identity lifecycle, and security workflows using Microsoft Entra ID, hybrid identity, and automation.

## Purpose
This repository documents a multi-phase, enterprise-style IAM lab designed to simulate how identity is governed, secured, and operated in real organizations.

The goal is to demonstrate practical IAM decision-making, documentation, and operational thinking not just feature configuration.

## Scope
This lab covers:
- Identity governance foundations
- Access control and least privilege
- Conditional access and risk-based policies
- Privileged access management
- Identity lifecycle (Joiner / Mover / Leaver)
- Hybrid identity considerations
- Auditing, logging, and incident response
- Automation and operational runbooks

## Lab Philosophy
This is treated as a living IAM environment:
- Changes are documented
- Decisions are justified
- Risks are identified
- Controls are validated

## Environment Overview
- Identity Platform: Microsoft Entra ID
- Identity Types: Cloud-only and hybrid
- Access Model: Role-based and group-based
- Security Controls: MFA, Conditional Access, PIM
- Automation: PowerShell / Microsoft Graph (where applicable)

## Repository Structure
Each phase represents a logical layer of enterprise IAM operations.

## Status
Phase 1: Foundation — In Progress
