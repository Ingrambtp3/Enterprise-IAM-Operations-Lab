# Phase 2 — Access Control

## Objective
Design and document how access is granted, limited, and enforced across identities,
applications, and roles based on the Phase 1 foundation.

## Core Questions This Phase Answers
- How is access granted to users and admins?
- What access is role-based vs group-based?
- How is least privilege enforced?
- How are access decisions reviewed and changed over time?

## Access Control Principles
- Access is granted through groups and roles, not directly to individuals
- Administrative access is separated and time-bound
- Access aligns with documented identity boundaries
- Every access path is auditable

## Scope
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Group-based access models
- Application access patterns
- Conditional access alignment
- Privileged role assignment strategy

## Status
In Progress
