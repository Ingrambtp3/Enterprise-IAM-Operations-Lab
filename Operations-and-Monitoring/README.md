# Phase 4 — Operations, Monitoring & Logging

## Objective
Establish visibility into identity and access activity to support governance,
incident detection, investigation, and audit readiness.

## Core Questions This Phase Answers
- What identity-related events are occurring?
- Can privileged activity be traced to individuals?
- Can governance decisions be validated with evidence?
- Can abnormal or risky behavior be detected?

## Operational Principles
- Logging is enabled intentionally, not by accident
- Identity events must be traceable and reviewable
- Logs support governance, security, and audit needs
- Signal is prioritized over noise

## Scope
- Sign-in and authentication logs
- Audit and directory change logs
- Privileged activity visibility
- Log retention and export
- Detection validation

## Relationship to Other Phases
- Observes access defined in Phase 2
- Validates governance rules from Phase 3
- Feeds evidence into Phase 6 (Testing) and Phase 7 (Proof)

## Status
In Progress
