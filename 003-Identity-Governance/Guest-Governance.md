# Guest Identity Governance

## Purpose
Define how external and guest identities are onboarded, governed, reviewed,
and removed to minimize risk while enabling collaboration.

## Governance Principles
- Guest access is exception-based, not default
- Every guest identity has an internal owner
- Guest access is time-bound and reviewed
- Guests are removed when no longer required

## Guest Onboarding Rules
- Guest accounts are created only for approved business purposes
- Each guest must have a documented internal sponsor
- Guest access is granted through dedicated guest access groups
- Guests do not receive baseline internal user access

## Access Restrictions
- Guests are restricted from administrative roles
- Guests are restricted to explicitly assigned applications
- Conditional Access policies apply to all guest sign-ins
- Guest access follows least-privilege principles

## Guest Access Duration
- Guest access is granted with an expected expiration
- Long-term guest access requires periodic re-approval
- Inactive guest accounts are candidates for removal

## Review & Oversight
- Guest access is reviewed on a defined cadence
- Reviews are owned by the guest sponsor or application owner
- Failure to review results in access removal or escalation

## Removal Triggers
Guest accounts are removed when:
- The business purpose ends
- The sponsor leaves the organization
- Access is no longer approved during review
- The account is inactive beyond an acceptable threshold

## Monitoring & Accountability
- Guest sign-in activity is logged
- Guest access changes are auditable
- Exceptions are documented and time-bound

## Governance Review
- Guest governance rules are reviewed periodically
- Guest access trends inform future policy adjustments
